Detecting melanoma with a CNN Neural Network

To this day cancer is considered one of the largest causes of death. Especially skin cancer, untreated, can lead to severe damage. However, the survival average is very high if it is diagnosed in its early stages. Therefore, the early diagnosis of these skin lesion is important to prevent death.

In the following I am creating a neural network which is classifying malicious skin lesions without the help of a doctor and thus accelerating the diagnosis.
