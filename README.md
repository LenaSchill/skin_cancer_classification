# Skin Cancer Classification
Detecting melanoma with a CNN

Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions.

This is the "Skin Cancer: Malignant vs Benign" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign) dataset. It consists of two folders with each 1800 pictures (224x244) of a balanced set of images of benign skin moles and malignant skin moles. All the rights of the Data are bound to the ISIC-Archive rights (https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main).

In this project I will try to detect whether a sind lesion is malignant or not using CNN with keras tensorflow in backend and then analyse the result to see how the model can be useful in practical scenario.
